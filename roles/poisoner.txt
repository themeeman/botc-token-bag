You are the Poisoner! :poisoner: You are a Minion on the evil team.

Each night, you will choose a player. This player will be poisoned tonight and the following day. Poisoned players will receive arbitrary info, and if their abilities affect the game in some way, they won't.

On the first night, you will be woken up with the other other minions and be informed who the Demon is.
